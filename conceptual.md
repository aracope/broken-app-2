### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is a JWT?
-- A JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe token used to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. It is often used for authentication and authorization, and it is signed (and optionally encrypted) to ensure integrity and authenticity.

- What is the signature portion of the JWT?  What does it do?
-- A JWT consists of three parts:
header.payload.signature. The signature is generated by encoding the header and payload, then signing them using a secret or private key. It ensures that the token has not been tampered with.

- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?
-- Yes — unless the JWT is encrypted. The payload is only encoded, not encrypted, so anyone can decode and view the claims inside. That’s why you should never put sensitive data (like passwords) in a JWT payload.

- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.
* User logs in -> app validates credentials
* App generates a JWT (with user info / claims) and sends it to the client
* Client stores the token (e.g., in localStorage or a cookie)
* On future requests -> client sends the token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header
* Server verifies the token’s signature → if valid, processes the request

- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
-- Unit: Smallest testing scope. Tests a piece of code (e.g. a function). Fast, isolated.
-- Integration:	Medium testing scope. Tests how components/modules work together.
-- End-to-End (E2E): Largest testing scope. Tests the whole system, user flows. Tests real-world scenarios, slowest.

- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?
-- A mock is a fake object/function that imitates real dependencies (e.g. DB, API, service) in a test, so you can:
* isolate logic
* control outputs
* avoid side effects

One might mock:
-- A database query function
-- A network request (e.g., fetch)
-- A third-party API

- What is continuous integration?
-- Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automatically building and testing code whenever changes are pushed to a shared repository. The goal is to catch issues early, keep code base healthy

- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?
-- An environment variable is a key-value pair stored outside the codebase, typically in the OS or a .env file.

-- Used for:
* Secrets (API keys, DB passwords)

* Config values (port number, debug flags)

* Environment settings (development vs. production)

- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is writing tests before you write the code.
-- Benefits:
* Forces clear requirements
* Leads to better design
* Gives high test coverage
-- Drawbacks:
* Can slow you down initially
* Hard to apply for UI-heavy code
* May lead to over-specifying behavior

- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?
* Provides a clear contract for expected JSON structure
* Ensures incoming data is valid before processing
* Reduces risk of runtime errors
* Easy to maintain and extend
* Can generate docs and UI forms from the schema

- What are some ways to decide which code to test?
-- Prioritize:
* Critical business logic
* Code that can break easily (edge cases, complex conditions)
* Public API endpoints
* Security-sensitive code
-- Less critical:
* Boilerplate
* Trivial getters/setters


- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?
-- RETURNING lets you get values from the rows modified by INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?
-- Web Sockets
* Persistent, full-duplex connection
* Client and server can send data anytime
* Better for real-time apps (chat, games)
*	One connection
-- HTTP
* Request-response per interaction
* Server can only respond to client requests
* Good for standard web requests
* New connection per request

- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right
  answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?
-- I prefer Flask overall, largely because I find Python as a language to be more readable and intuitive than JavaScript. I appreciate how Flask’s simplicity and clear structure make it easy to follow and debug code. The error messages in Flask also feel more informative to me, which helps with troubleshooting. That said, I do like that Express isn’t dependent on whitespace or indentation for functionality; I can see how that could reduce certain kinds of bugs. Both have their strengths, but Flask aligns more with my personal coding style so far.
